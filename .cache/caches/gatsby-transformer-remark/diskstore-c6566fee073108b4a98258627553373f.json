Let's start this journey together. My name is Rolwin and I'm a full-stack web developer 🕸️. I have been an opensource contributor for a very long time since 2016. Currently I'm a part of Gatsby organization contributing to <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gatsby.js</a>.</p>\n<p>The world of <code class=\"language-text\">World Wide Web</code> 🌐 had always fascinated me for a very long time. Ever since my only dream 🙃 was to architect real-time applications that millions of people use in real-time, for instance a 🚗 taxi booking app, a food delivery 🍔 app or some online 💵 payment app. I strongly believe the world of <code class=\"language-text\">Web Technology</code> is going to transform the world in the near future. Currently a lot of  🕸️ web apps that are built behave more like mobile 📱 app and show real-time data. In the near future the web is going to be a huge setup that will link most of the IoT devices together.</p>\n<p>In my early teens 👦🏻 I was not a good coder 👨🏽‍💻 as such. I could hardly write a <code class=\"language-text\">C Program</code> and could not even understand many use-cases 😷 of these programs. Probably because I was not much of a book worm 🐛. Things changed in the year 2015 and my fascination towards programming increased and in the year 2016 I started programming the <code class=\"language-text\">Web</code>. Today I'm a full-stack web developer 👨🏽‍💻 working with multiple technologies. Currently I work with mostly <code class=\"language-text\">Javascript</code> tech stacks like <code class=\"language-text\">ReactJS</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">NodeJS</code>. I'm open to discussions on various Javascript technologies. I will try to update my blog as much as possible so that many of you can get an idea of the latest trends in technologies. </p>"}
