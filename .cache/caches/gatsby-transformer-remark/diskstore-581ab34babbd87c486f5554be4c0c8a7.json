Previously I used to run my website on Wordpress. But recently I migrated my website and blog from Wordpress to Gatsby.</p>\n<h2>So is wordpress bad and I decided to migrate my website ü§î ?</h2>\n<p>No absolutely not. That would be stupid to say Wordpress is bad. In fact, I believe it is a wonderful platform to build websites without much technical knowledge. <code class=\"language-text\">Wordpress</code> is powered by <code class=\"language-text\">PHP</code>. It's a full-fledged platform that is good for blogging, marketing, creating dynamic websites and even supports eCommerce websites for small businesses. There are many plugins that are available for WordPress for different purposes and can be integrated with it very well.</p>\n<h2>What is wordpress ?</h2>\n<p>Wordpress is an <code class=\"language-text\">opensource</code> content management system that is built on top of <code class=\"language-text\">PHP</code> and a <code class=\"language-text\">MySql</code> database. It gives a lot of flexibility to build dynamic websites and there are millions of themes and plugins available for Wordpress that makes it easy for anyone to build websites without much technical knowledge. You can get your website rolling over a night by using the ready made themes that are available out there. There are plenty of <code class=\"language-text\">Wordpress</code> hosting systems out there that take care of your deployment as well.</p>\n<h2>Then What's Gatsby ?</h2>\n<p>Gatsby is a static page generator that takes data from various data sources and produces <code class=\"language-text\">graphql</code> API's that can be consumed by the frontend and once the build is taken the static pages are generated for the dynamic data. More over it's a framework built on top of <code class=\"language-text\">ReactJS</code> that takes care of lot of challenges while building <code class=\"language-text\">react</code> application. The most common data source that I use is transforming the markdowns into graphql data using the <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-transformer-remark</code> plugin. Gatsby can also take data from sources like Wordpress and other CMS like drupal, contentful, etc. In short Gatsby‚Äôs data plugin ecosystem lets you build sites with the data you want ‚Äî from one or many sources: get data from SaaS services, headless CMSs, APIs, databases, your file system, and more directly into your pages using GraphQL .</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 57.199999999999996%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"gatsby deploy\"\n        title=\"gatsby deploy\"\n        src=\"/static/7a1abffce002a6494b5db8bb92428366/332ff/gatsby-deploy.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7a1abffce002a6494b5db8bb92428366/3e256/gatsby-deploy.png 250w,\n/static/7a1abffce002a6494b5db8bb92428366/b30f8/gatsby-deploy.png 500w,\n/static/7a1abffce002a6494b5db8bb92428366/332ff/gatsby-deploy.png 1000w,\n/static/7a1abffce002a6494b5db8bb92428366/846e3/gatsby-deploy.png 1251w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Gatsby has a lot of plugins that can be used for various other purposes. But you need to be a bit of a coding geek to work with <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why I migrated to gatsby?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3>Performance in mind</h3>\n<p>The first reason was keeping the performance of my web application in mind. Since gatsby is a single page application and serves mostly statically generated pages the performance is quite good with minimal deployment charges. Gatsby also optimizes the images that it serves. It also takes care of <code class=\"language-text\">prefetch</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">preload</code> of data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Cost of deployment</h3>\n<p>The cost of deploying a gatsby application is way cheaper than a WordPress application. <code class=\"language-text\">Netlify</code> provides a free deployment plan with <code class=\"language-text\">HTTPS</code> encryption. Suppose we are hosting a Wordpress application we need considerably a good server with a <code class=\"language-text\">MySql</code> database. So the cost will be a bit higher for this setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>I'm a developer</h3>\n<p>Since I'm a developer I could build the gatsby theme from scratch with a bit of <code class=\"language-text\">Javascript</code> coding. I automated the deployment process using <code class=\"language-text\">Netlify</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Github</code>. So whenever I need to deploy some changes I just need to commit to my master branch and the deployment will be taken care of by the CI/CD setup of <code class=\"language-text\">Netlify</code>. I'm also comfortable writing the markdowns for my blog which is dynamic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>SEO is also taken care</h3>\n<p>One important thing for me was branding my name <code class=\"language-text\">Rolwin Reevan</code> over the internet. For this all the factors of SEO had to be taken care which is a bit challenging. Since gatsby renders static pages the performance is good, which enhances the <code class=\"language-text\">SEO</code> as well. There are plugins for SEO in gatsby. Server-Side-Rendering (<code class=\"language-text\">SSR</code>) is also supported by gatsby.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Gatsby satisfies my use-case</h3>\n<p>Most importantly gatsby was satisfying my use-case with minimal cost. My use-case before building my website was a static landing page and a dynamic blog. Even <code class=\"language-text\">Wordpress</code> satisfies this use-case very well, but like I told the cost of deployment is higher for WordPress than a gatsby application and moreover I didn't want all the features that WordPress provides.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>When to go for wordpress and when to go for gatsby?</h2>\n<p>So It depends on the use-case when to go for Gatsby and When to go for Wordpress</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you have a team of more than 5 non-technical people working for some content marketing company then going for WordPress will be a good idea because gatsby involves a bit of technical work. If you are a javascript developer or a full stack web developer who wants to just build his portfolio and have a blog then gatsby is a good idea if you are maintaining the website by yourself.</li>\n<li>If cost is not much of your concern and ease of use is your concern then going for wordpress is a good idea. Because Wordpress involves a lot of plugins like wp-bakery, yoast, etc, that makes drag and drop functionality and SEO easier. If cost is your concern and you are ready for some little hard work you can go for Gatsby.</li>\n<li>If you are planning for an online e-commerce application for small businesses with email marketing then Wordpress is probably a better solution than Gatsby I believe. The reason is you can build an e-commerce website easily with Wordpress. There are many plugins and themes that are available to set up an e-commerce website with Wordpress and you can easily keep track of your leads. The most commonly used Wordpress plugin for e-commerce application is <code class=\"language-text\">woocommerce</code>.</li>\n<li>SEO and Performance in mind with minimal cost then <code class=\"language-text\">Gatsby</code> is the solution you can build a SPA and PWA applications easily with <code class=\"language-text\">Gatsby</code>. Even Wordpress has some cool plugins like <code class=\"language-text\">Yoast</code> for SEO and there are some very good flexibility while using Wordpress enhancing the SEO without much technical knowledge but you need a very good server to keep the performance of the <code class=\"language-text\">Wordpress</code> site up. If SEO is your concern then you should make sure that your site renders in less then 3 seconds.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Building a Gatsby application</h2>\n<p>There are plenty of different ways to build gatsby websites.
